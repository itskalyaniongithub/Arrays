//Isyana is given the number of visitors at her local theme park on N consecutive days. The number of visitors on the i-th day is V,. A day is record breaking if it satisfies both of the following conditions:
//• The number of visitors on the day is strictly larger than the number of visitors on each of the previous days.
//• Either it is the last day, or the number of visitors on the day is strictly larger than the number of visitors on the following day.
//Note that the very first day could be a record breaking day!

 

//CODE : 


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int recordBreak(int array[],int l){
    int i=0;
    int max = 0;
    while(i<l){
        if(array[i]>max && array[i]>array[i+1]){
            max = array[i];
            cout<<"Its a record breaking day "<<i+1<<" with "<<array[i]<<" entry.";
            cout<<'\n';
        }
        i=i+1;
    }
    return 0;
}

    int l ;
